				<h3>Ingredients</h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type:none">
					<li>90g margarine or butter</li>
					<li>90g granulated sugar</li>
					<li>250g self-raising flour</li>
					<li>30g finely chopped mixed peel</li>
					<li>1 egg (+ some milk if needed)</li>
				</ul>

				<h4><emph>Indicative cost of ingredients: </emph>Â£ (inexpensive)
				</h4>

				<p></p>

				<h3>Method</h3>
				<p>
					Put the flour and sugar into a mixing bowl and use your fingertips to rub in the butter (or
					margarine) until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the egg and use a fork to mix in until
					the dough sticks together and lumps will just slowly drop off the fork (add milk if too try, add
					flour if too wet). Divide into eight rough lumps (rocks!) on a greased baking tray and bake at 220
					degrees C (200 degrees C for fan oven) for around 15 minutes until golden brown on top. They will be
					soft to the touch until they cool down and develop their rocky crust.
				</p>

				<h3>Why I chose this recipe</h3>
				<p>
					My Grandma's rock buns (some people call them 'rock cakes' apparently, but to us they were
					definitely always 'buns'!) were a staple treat of my childhood - and also whenever in adulthood I
					would visit my Grandma in Cornwall these were often served alongside a cup of tea to welcome her
					guests. I'm reasonably sure that my Grandad would have had one of these every day for his
					'elevenses' (usually quite a bit earlier than 11am I think though...) for around 40 years or so!
				</p>
				<p>
					One of my cousins was wise enough to get Grandma to write down all her best recipes a few years back
					(including of
					course her recipe for Cornish pasties - but I thought that might be a bigger challenge for me to try
					to bake for the
					first time to submit for this book!) and the recipes were all shared with the family around the time
					of Grandma's
					funeral last year. This book got me to try to bake rock buns for the first time in my life - and it
					was even easier
					than I was expecting, and *almost* as delicious as those my Grandma used to make. I encourage you to
					give it a go
					yourself, and enjoy alongside a nice cup of tea or coffee.
